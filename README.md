This is only for txt file.

The scripts include average multi-blanks, background subtraction, MS alignment, MS filter, KNN imputation, t-test, and fold change
For annotation and formula assignment could be conducted on MPF software.
For multi-varaiate analysis, MetaboAnalyst and Simca-P could be options.
There some example data from my own work. 

For AP-MALDI, the imaging data could be checked and processed using ShinyCardinal. 
After selecting the ROI and exporting data with m/z and corresponding intensity,
